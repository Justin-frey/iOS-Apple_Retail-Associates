1. How to use your MagSafe Battery Pack.

Your MagSafe Battery Pack is designed to
quickly and safely wirelessly charge iPhone
models with MagSafe, giving you more time to
use your device.

2. How to Charge your MagSafe Battery Pack.

Before you use your MagSafe Battery Pack for
the first time, fully charge it using a Light 
ning to USB cable with a 20W or higher power
adapter.

•Plug one end of a Lightning to USB cable
into the Lightning connector on your MagSafe
Battery Pack.
•Plug the other end of the cable into a 20W
or higher USB power adapter, then plug the
adapter into a power outlet. The status light
on your MagSafe Battery Pack will stay lit
for about 8 seconds. 

While your MagSafe Battery Pack is charging,
the status light might flash. If it flashes
green, your battery pack is fully charged.
If it flashes amber, your battery pack might
need more time to charge. 

Using an adapter that isn't 20W or higher
will result in a slower charge.

3. Attaching and remove your MagSafe Battery
Pack.

Your MagSafe Battery Pack will magnetically
attach to the back of your iPhone. To remove
the MagSafe Battery Pack, gently pull it off
the back of your device. 

If connected to a 20W or higher power source,
your MagSafe Battery Pack can charge your
iPhone with up to 15W of power.
In order to get 7.5W charging on the go,
update your MagSafe Battery Pack to the
latest firmware. The firmware update begins
automatically after you attach your battery
pack to your iPhone. The firmware update can
take about one week.
To update the firmware using a Mac or an
iPad model with a USB-C port, detach the
battery pack from your iPhone, plug one end
of a Lightning to USB cable into the
Lightning connector on your battery pack,
and the other end into your Mac or iPad.
The firmware update will take about 5 minutes.
